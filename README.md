## About The Project

The **Retail Sales Data Analysis** project highlights the practical application of SQL in analyzing and deriving actionable insights from retail sales data. Designed for professionals and aspiring data analysts, this project offers hands-on experience in working with structured datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering business-critical questions. 

The dataset is inspired by real-world retail environments, featuring detailed transaction-level data. Key fields include transaction details, customer demographics, sales categories, and financial metrics, making it an ideal simulation platform for business intelligence tasks.

## Key Features

This project demonstrates how to effectively utilize SQL in analyzing retail sales data and solving business challenges. The key components of the project include:

1. **Database Creation and Setup**: 
   - Design and populate a robust retail sales database, including transactional and demographic data, to enable detailed analysis.
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: 
   - Identify and handle missing, null, or inconsistent values to ensure data quality and reliability.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Discover patterns and trends in sales data, such as customer behavior, category performance, and revenue distribution.

4. **Business Insights Generation**:
   - Use SQL queries to answer critical business questions, including:
     - Which product categories drive the most revenue?
     - How do customer age groups influence purchasing behavior?
     - What are the peak sales times and days?
